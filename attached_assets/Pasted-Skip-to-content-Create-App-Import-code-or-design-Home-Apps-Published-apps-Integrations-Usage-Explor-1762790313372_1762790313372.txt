Build a complete, production-ready, no-code investor portal for a DLD-compliant fractional off-plan real estate platform in Dubai called "FOPD" (Fractional Off-Plan Dubai). The platform allows up to 10 co-owners per off-plan apartment with direct title deed registration (no SPV, no DFSA license). Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrate with Telr or PayTabs for payments and WhatsApp Business API for notifications.
